# Win10_XForce_Desktop_Automator
This utility is designed to deploy a (unix) XForce desktop environment on Microsoft Windows 10 devices.
I have programmed this utility alone and I am a beginner in BAT/PowerShell.
Please do not blame me as I know that this software is not optimized as far as it could be.
