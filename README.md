# Win10_XForce_Desktop_Env
This utility is designed to deploy a (unix) XForce desktop environment on Microsoft Windows 10 devices.
I have programmed this utility alone and my skills in BAT/PowerShell are very limited.
Please do not blame me as I know that this software is not optimized as far as it could be.

# Ideas welcome !
Feel free to suggest possible enhancements or extensions.

# Target device requirements
- Windows 10 (all editions* - minimum version - 1804)
- 100 MB of disk space
- Trust PowerShell policy (or temporary disable it) before running the software

*Windows 10 IoT & Windows 10 N - to be tested


# Supported Linux distributions
